Has - A Relationship :-
********************
=> HAS-A Relationship is a concept of declaring user defined data type as an instance variable.

class Item
	{
private String name = "Santoor";
private int price = 35;

public void getItemDetails()
{
	System.out.println(" Name  : "+name);
	System.out.println(" Price : "+price);
}
	}

class Store
	{
private Item i = new Item(); // HAS-A Relationship

public void getStockInfo()
{
	System.out.println(" Available Stock is :");
	i.getItemDetails();
}
	}


USE - A Relationship :-
********************
=> USE-A Relationship is a concept of defining user defined data type as a local variable within a method.

class Item
	{
public void getItemData()
{
System.out.println(" From Item : This is an information about Item ");
}
	}


class Shop
	{
public void displayItems(Item obj) // USE-A Relationship
{
obj.getItemData();
}
	}



final keyword concept :-
*********************

final is a keyword which can be applied to a

	=> Variable
		OR
	=> Method 
		OR
	=> Class


final Varible :-
**************
=> If we declare a variable as final which can not be modified.
=> For the final variables default values won't be assigned by the JVM.
=> final variables must be initialized before using.

Blank final varible :-
********************
** We can initialize the final variable within the constructor which is called blank final variable.

Blank Final Varibles can be used for the implementation of PANCard application.

Note:-
****
** If it is a static final variable , we can initialize them in static block.


final method :-
*************
=> If we declare a method as final which can not be overridden.


final class :-
************
	If we declare a class as "final" , which can not be inherited.

Sample.java
***********
final class Sample
	{
public void getInfo()
{
System.out.println("\n\n Information about the Sample Class :");
}
	}

class Child extends Sample
	{
	}


Once we compile this we get the following error : -

Sample.java:9: error: cannot inherit from final Sample
class Child extends Sample

Understanding static concept :-
*****************************
Java gives "static" concept for memory management.

"static" is a keyword which can applied 
i) to a variable
ii) to a method
iii) to a block.


1) static variable :-
   ****************
=> For a static variable memory will be allocated only once.
=> All the static variables will be instantiated  within the " static area or class area " at the time of class loading.
=> Static variable can be shared by all the Object's.
