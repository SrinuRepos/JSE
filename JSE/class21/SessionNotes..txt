Checked Exceptions :-
*******************
=> The exception which is a sub class of "java.lang.Exception" class is called Checked Exception.

=> Checked Exception can be verified at compile time so all the checked exceptions should be handled at compile time.

Ex : ClassNotFoundException,InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException


UN-Checked Exceptions :-
*******************
=> The exception which is a sub class of "java.lang.RuntimeException" class is called UN-Checked Exception.

=> UnChecked Exception can be verified at run time so all the unchecked exceptions need not to handled at compile time.

Ex : NullPointerException, ArithmeticException etc..


throws keyword :-
**************

=> throws keyword can be used to declare the exception.

=> throws keyword  can declared checked and unchecked exceptions.

=> When the method declares a checked exception, the caller should handle the exception.

=> When the method declares a UN-Checked exception, the caller need not to handle the exception.

=> throws keyword will allways indicates to caller , what kind of exception a method can be thrown. So that caller can handle exception.

For  Ex :

As we discussed in "java.lang.Class" has 

  1. public static Class forName(String) throws ClassNotFoundException;
	
	The "forName(String)" will throw ClassNotFoundException if we pass invalid class name.

  
  2.public Object newInstance() throws InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException;
	
	In generally the newInstance() creates the loaded class Object using defaultconstructor.

	If the loaded class does not contains the default constructor then newInstance() method throws the InstantiationException.

	If the loaded class default constructor as private then the newInstance() method throws IllegalAccessException.


ClassNotFoundException , InstantiationException ,IllegalAccessException exceptions are checked exceptions so that all these exceptions should be handled at compile time.


Understanding 'throw' keyword :-
******************************

=> 'throw' keyword can used to forward  the exceptions .

=>  The 'throw' can stop the flow of execution and forwards the exception to the caller.

=>  throw keyword can forward checked and un checked exceptions.

=>  Checked exceptions should be declared on the method header before forwarding using "throw" keyword.

=> UNChecked exception can be forwarded directly using "throw" keyword.

=> For forwarding UnChecked Exception declaration is not needed.


Userdefined Exceptions :-
**********************

=> The Exceptions  which are developed by the  Programer can be called as UserDefinedExceptions.

=> UserDefined Exceptions can be checked or unchecked exception

Procedure to develop Userdefined Exceptions :-
*******************************************

1. Develop a java class by extending either "java.lang.Exception" OR  "java.lang.RuntimeException" class.

2. Define the default constructor within the java class.

3. Define the parameterized constructor which is taking "String" as a parameter and call the super class parameterized constructor.

	Calling super class constructor help us to display exception message in a simple way.
	

InsuffientBalanceException.java

package com.oracle.exp;

public class InsuffientBalanceException extends Exception
	{
public InsuffientBalanceException()
{
	super();
}

public InsuffientBalanceException(String expDesc)
{
super(expDesc);
}
	}
