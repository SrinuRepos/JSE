understanding "this" keyword :-
*****************************
=> "this" is an implicit reference variable created by JVM at the time of Object creation.
=> "this" keyword is used to by the JVM inorder to refer current class instance variables and methods.
=> "this" will allways refers current class instance (i.e object).

Ex: -ThisVarApp.java , ThisVarApp diagram.

Usage of this : -
**************
** Whenever Local Variables and Instance Variables are same , we can deferentiate them using "this" keyword.

Ex: -

Inheritance :-
************
Inheritance is a concept of reusing properties of one class into another class.

In java Inheritance can be supported in 3 ways

1. IS - A Relationship

2. HAS - A Relationship

3. USE - A Relationship.


=> IS - A Relationship :-
   ******************

	In case "IS - A Relationship" we use "extends" to reuse properties of one class into another class.

There are 3 types of "IS - A Relationship's"

1. Single Level Inheritance 

2. Multi Level Inheritance 

3. Hierarchical Inheritance 

Single Level Inheritance : Here we have single level of inheritance. Ex:- Relationship with "Father and Son".

Multi Level Inheritance : Here we have more than one level of inheritance. Ex:- Relationship with 
			  "GrandFather and Father and Son ".

Hierarchical Inheritance : Here one parent can have more than once child classes.

refer Inheritance Diagram.


Why java does not support multiple inheritance ?

refer MultipleInheritance diagram.

Observations on inheritance Concept :-
***********************************
1. Whenever we inherit the class, the parent data can never loaded into the child class.Still the child class can able to refere parent data using "super concept" in java.

refer InheritanceObs1App.java


2. The "private" members of Parent class won't be accessible from child class.

refer InheritanceObs2App.java

We will get the following  error: sampleName has private access in Sample
System.out.println(" From Test : sampleName  "+sampleName );

super keyword && super()  constructor :-
****		 *******

super keyword :-
****
=> "super" keyword is an implicit reference variable , created by JVM for super class object.

=> "super" keyword will allways represents Super class Instance.

=> When super class variables and child class variable both are same , we can differentiate them using "super" keyword.

refer SuperEx1.java


super()  constructor :-
*******

=> super() constructor is used by the JVM inorder invoke super class constructor.

=> JVM by defaultly adds "super()" constructor  as a first statement within the Child Constructor.

=> Whenever we are trying to create child class object, JVM internally creates super class object using "super()" constructor.

=> The super class object will be refered by the JVM using an implicit reference variable i.e "super".

refer SuperEx.java and SuperDiagram.

=> Within the parent class if there is no defualt constructor we should class explicitly using super() constructor.

reder SuperEx2.java

=> The caling to super() constructor must be the first statement within the constructor.
