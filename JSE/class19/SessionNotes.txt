package :- 
******

	A Package is a group of related java classes or interfaces or abstract classes or sub packages.

Advantage of package :	
Maintaining the application becomes very easier.


There are two types of packages 
	
1.Predefined Packages

2.Userdefined packages.

	refer packages diagram.

Predefined Packages :-
=> Predefined Packages are used by the java programmer to develop java application.
=> All the Predefined Packages will be available from JDK installation.

ex :- java.lang , java.io, java.util etc..


=> Whatever classes which are presented in "java.lang" package, can be directly used in java programe.

=> We should use "import" keyword to reuse the classes which are present in other packages ex: java.util,java.io etc..


java.util.Scanner :-
*****************
"java.util.Scanner" class can be used to read the data from console.

Scanner Constructor :-
*******************
public Scanner(InputStream) :- We can create a object of Scanner by using this constructor.


=> The java.lang.System class has a static reference variable as "in" which is pointing to "java.io.InputStream" object.

public final class java.lang.System {
  public static final java.io.InputStream in;
  public static final java.io.PrintStream out;
	......	
	.....
	}

Now we can create the "java.util.Scanner" class object as 

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);


=> The "java.util.Scanner" class has given set of methods to read the input data.

	1. public int nextInt() :- which is used to read Integer data
	2. public float nextFloat() :- which is used to read Float data
	
Similarly we have public boolean nextBoolean(),public boolean nextLong(),public double nextDouble() etc.

	3.public String next() :- which is used to read "String" type of data.


UserDefined Packages :-
*********************
=> All the UserDefined Packages are created by the java programmer.
=> We can create a package using "package " keyword.
=> the "package" statment must be first statement within the java programe.

structure of the java programe is : 

	package package_Name	
	import ....
	..........
	public class Class_Name
	{
....
....
....
	}
	
=> standard to defined the package_name as "com or org . company or org name . purpose".

	Ex :- org.adp.io => This package contains all the java classes developed by programer related to io devices.

	      org.jpmorgan.util => => This package contains all the java classes developed by programer related to common functionalities.
	
etc..

=>  Compilation Syntax for packages : *** 

	compile > javac -d . *.java 

( java compiler compiles all the classes presented in current directory and creates the packages i.e sub folders).

	-d indicates the directory.

	"." dot indicates current directory.

	"*" all the java files.


=> To Run > java completePackagename.Class_Name

PrintNumbersApp.java
********************

package com.oracle.test;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class PrintNumbersApp
	{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(" Please enter number");
int n = scan.nextInt();
for(int i=1 ; i <= n ;i++)
{
System.out.println(i);
}
}
	}


Compile > javac -d . *.java

After successfull compilataion of a java programe then JVM will create the "PrintNumbersApp.class" file under com/oracle/test folder.

RUN > java com.oracle.test.PrintNumbersApp


Understanding Access Specifiers with repect to Packages :-

1. public  :- If we declare a class or method or variable as public , which can accessible in any where.

		within the class,within Package and outside the package.

2. protected  :- If we declare a  method or variable as protected , which can accessible  within the class and within Package directly but  outside the package can be accessible only through inheritance.
	


3. default  :- If we declare a  method or variable or class as default , which can be accessible  within the class and within Package directly but  outside the package can not be accessible .


4. private :- If we declare a  method or variable as private , which can accessible  only within the class .

Note :-
*****
	1. If all the classes presented in same package then we need not to write "import" statement.

Sample.java
	package com.oracle;
	public class Sample
	{
....
	}


Test.java

	package com.oracle;
	public class Test
	{
	public void getInfo()	
	{
Sample s = new Sample();
....
....
	}
	}


	2. If we write import com.oracle.*; then all the classe of com.oracle package can be imported into our main class.


	package com.nit.app;
	import com.oracle.Sample;
	import com.oracle.Test;

	public class TestApp
	{
.....
....
	}

	OR

	package com.nit.app;
	import com.oracle.*;	

	public class TestApp
	{
.....
....
	}
