SampleApp.java Flow Notes:-
*************************
When we compile a SampleApp.java , java compiler generates Sample.class and SampleApp.class within the HardDisk.

	While Running we use "java SampleApp".

Here the java tool activates JAM in the RAM. Then the JVM does the following jobs.

1. JVM loads SampleApp.class file into method Area of a RAM.

2. JVM calls the main(..) method.

3. Whenever JVM finds new keyword does the following jobs.

	a) Loads Sample.class file into method Area
	b) create a Object for Sample.class in the Heap.
		Creating a Object is nothing but allocating a memory for the 		datamembers of a class.
	c)Sample Object will be refered by a reference 's' from the stack.

4) JVM access count, name varibles with reference 's' and display them on the screen.

5) s.display();

	Here the display() loads into a stackframe of stack. The method will be executed within the stackframe.
	Once the method execution is completed then stackframe will be terminated from the stack.

Ex: - If we call display() 3 times.

	3 stack frames will be created in the stack then display() method executes 3 times.


InstanceAndLocalVariablesEx.java Flow Notes:-
*************************
When we compile a InstanceAndLocalVariablesEx.java  , java compiler generates Sample.class and InstanceAndLocalVariablesEx.class within the HardDisk.

	While Running we use "java InstanceAndLocalVariablesEx".

Here the java tool activates JAM in the RAM. Then the JVM does the following jobs.

1. JVM loads InstanceAndLocalVariablesEx.class file into method Area of a RAM.

2. JVM calls the main(..) method.

3. Whenever JVM finds new keyword does the following jobs. 
	Sample s = new Sample() // logic

	a) Loads Sample.class file into method Area
	b) create a Object for Sample.class in the Heap.
		Creating a Object is nothing but allocating a memory for the 		Instance Variables of a class.
	c) JVM assigns default values to the instance variables after cration 		of the object.
		JVM assing following defaults values.
		=> For Numeric Data (byte,shot,int,long) default value = 0
		=> For Floating Data (float,double) default value = 0.0
		=> For  Boolean Data (boolean) default value = false
		=> For String Data (String) default value = null
		=> For Charecter Data (char) default value = empty space
		
	d)Sample Object will be refered by a reference 's' from the stack.



4) s.display();

	Here the display() loads into a stackframe of stack. The method will be executed within the stackframe.
	Once the method execution is completed then stackframe will be terminated from the stack.

Ex: - If we call display() 3 times.

	3 stack frames will be created in the stack then display() method executes 3 times.
