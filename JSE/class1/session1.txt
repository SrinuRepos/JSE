Java is a Object Oritented Programing language so in an Object Orientation everthing can be represented as Classes and Objects.


	class :-
	****
	class is a user defined datatype.	
	class is a collection data members and methods.
	class is a logical view.
	We can not feel the class without an object.


	class <ClassName>
		{
		   Data_Members;
		   Methods;
		}

	Ex:
		class AccountHolder
			{
			  long accountNo = 12435783 ;
			  String accountName = "Srinu";
			  float accountBalance = 150.50f; <DATA_Memebers>
 			
				methods ....
			
			}

******************************************************************************
Developing first program in java :-
*******************************
1. Write a program

	public class HelloWorld
	{
public static void main(String args[])
{
  System.out.println(" Welcome To Java => From Data Geeks");
  
}
	}

2. Save the file name as "HelloWorld.java" into ../JSE/class1 directory.

3. Open command prompt with directory ../JSE/class1
	
		Navigate to the directory folder then type "cmd" up on the folder browser.

		This will open command prompt with the directory location as ../JSE/class1.

4.Compile the program

		javac HelloWorld.java

	If we recieve error as 
'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

	We need to set the java path.

	There are 2 ways to solve:

		1. Temporary solution : update the path variable on command prompt.

	../JSE/class1 > set path=.;c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_45\bin
	
		Here the problem is the path is gone once we close command prompt.

		2. Perminent Solution

		Right click on Computer => Properties => Advanced System Settings => Environment Variables => User Variables => Click on new 
		=> new prompt will open 

			Name : path
			value : c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_45\bin

		click on OK .

	Note :
	*****	The perminent path changes applies only after restart of commadn prompt.

	
	If the programe compiles successfully, then java compiler generates a HelloWorld.class file into ../JSE/class1 directory.


5. Run the java program.

		java HelloWorld


Observations :-
************
	=>  JVM always loads .class file into RAM then calls the main(..) method.
		If the main(..) method is not defined properly give an error at Runtime.
		
	=> Every change in .java file will be applicable only after compilation.
	
	=> If we give invalid class while running the program gives NoClassDefination Error.
