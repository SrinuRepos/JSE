		Inter-thread Communication in Java

What is Polling and what are problems with it?

The process of testing a condition repeatedly till it becomes true is known as polling.Polling is usually implemented with the help of loops to check whether a particular condition is true or not. If it is true, certain action is taken. This waste many CPU cycles and makes the implementation inefficient.

For example, in a classic queuing problem where one thread is producing data and other is consuming it.

How Java multi threading tackles this problem?

To avoid polling, Java uses three methods, namely, wait(), notify() and notifyAll().

All these methods belong to object class as final so that all classes have them. They must be used within a synchronized block only.

wait()-It tells the calling thread to give up the lock and go to sleep until some other thread enters the same monitor and calls notify().

notify()-It wakes up one single thread that called wait() on the same object. It should be noted that calling notify() does not actually give up a lock on a resource.

notifyAll()-It wakes up all the threads that called wait() on the same object.

				Thread Pools in Java
Background:

Server Programs such as database and web servers repeatedly execute requests from multiple clients and these are oriented around processing a large number of short tasks. An approach for building a server application would be to create a new thread each time a request arrives and service this new request in the newly created thread. While this approach seems simple to implement, it has significant disadvantages. A server that creates a new thread for every request would spend more time and consume more system resources in creating and destroying threads than processing actual requests.

Since active threads consume system resources, a JVM creating too many threads at the same time can cause the system to run out of memory. This necessitates the need to limit the number of threads being created.


What is ThreadPool in Java?

A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to the problem of thread cycle overhead and resource thrashing. Since the thread is already existing when the request arrives, the delay introduced by thread creation is eliminated, making the application more responsive.

Java provides the Executor framework which is centered around the Executor interface, its sub-interface –ExecutorService and the class-ThreadPoolExecutor, which implements both of these interfaces. By using the executor, one only has to implement the Runnable objects and send them to the executor to execute.

They allow you to take advantage of threading, but focus on the tasks that you want the thread to perform, instead of thread mechanics.
To use thread pools, we first create a object of ExecutorService and pass a set of tasks to it. ThreadPoolExecutor class allows to set the core and maximum pool size.The runnables that are run by a particular thread are executed sequentially.

Executor Thread Pool Methods

Method                         Description
newFixedThreadPool(int)           Creates a fixed size thread pool.

newCachedThreadPool()             Creates a thread pool that creates new 
                                  threads as needed, but will reuse previously 
                                  constructed threads when they are available

newSingleThreadExecutor()         Creates a single thread. 

In case of a fixed thread pool, if all threads are being currently run by the executor then the pending tasks are placed in a queue and are executed when a thread becomes idle.

Steps to be followed

1. Create a task(Runnable Object) to execute
2. Create Executor Pool using Executors
3. Pass tasks to Executor Pool
4. Shutdown the Executor Pool
