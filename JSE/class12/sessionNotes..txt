Recursion in Java :

Recursion in java is a process in which a method calls itself continuously. 
A method in java that calls itself is called recursive method.
It makes the code compact but complex to understand.

Encapsulation :-
**************
We should not access the data members of a class directly. We should access them only through functionality.
In simple Encapsulation bind the data and functionality togather.

This can be achieved in java using access specifiers.

Java has given following predefined access specifiers .

	1. public :- If we declare any class or method or variable as public , which can be accessible within the class , within the package,outside the package. (any where).


	2. protected :-If we declare any  method or variable as protected, which can be accessible within the class and within the package directly. But outside the package can be accessible only through inheritance.

	3. defulat :-
	   *******
	If we don't specify any access specifier then it is called default access specifier.
	If the class or method or variable has default access specifier which can be accessible only within the class,within package.


	4. private :- 
	   *******
		If we declare variable or method as private , which can be accessible only within the class.

Note :-
*****
	The protected and private access specifiers can not be applicable to "class".

Ex :- BankApp.java
	

constructor :-
**********
=> constructor is a special type of method.
=> constructor does not contains the return type.
=> constructor name should be same as class name.

Ex: -
****
	class Sample
	{
		int count;

		public void display()
		{
		....
		....
		}//method

	public Sample()
		{
	count = 10; //initialization logic
	.....
	.....
		}//Constructor
	}

=> Constructor is invoked by the JVM at the time of Object creation.

	Sample s = new Sample();

=> The main usage of constructor is to develop initialization logic.
=> Which means constructor is used to initialize instanace variables of a java class.


There are two types of Constructors

	1. Default constructor.
	2. Parameterized Constructor.

Default constructor :-
*******************
=> Default Constructor does not contains any parameters.

	class Sample
	{

	public Sample( )
	{
	....
	....
	}// Default Constructor.

	}
	
=> If we don't write any constructor within the java class then JVM will automatically creates the default constructor.
=> JVM creates the default constructor to assign the default values to the instance variables of a java class.

Ex: DefaultConstructorApp.java

class Sample
	{
 int count;
 String name;

public void display()
{
System.out.println("\n Count : "+count);
System.out.println("\n Name : "+name);
}
	}

public class DefaultConstructorApp
	{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Sample s = new Sample();
s.display();
}
	}

=> Here within the "Sample" class we did not write the default constructor so JVM will automatically creates the default constructor in "Sample" class.

=> CMD > javac DefaultConstructorApp.java
=> CMD > javap Sample

class Sample {
  int count;
  java.lang.String name;

  Sample();// this is added by JVM 

  public void display();
}

Ex2 :-
****
DefaultConstructorApp2.java

2. Parameterized Constructor :-
   *************************
** => Parameterized Constructor contains the parameters.
   => If we write Parameterized Constructor within the java class then JVM does not creates the default constructor.
   => Parameterized Constructor can be used to pass different values to the different objects as runtime.

Ex:- CollegeApp.java


Method Overloading :-
******************
Method Overloading is a concept of defining the Same method within the java class by changing the number of  parameters and type of parameters.

Ex: - MethodOverloadingEx.java

Advantage :-
**********
MethodOverloading increases the readability of the Java Program.
